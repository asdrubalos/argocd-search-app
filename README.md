## Requirements

- ```argocd``` CLI:
It will be necessary to list the applications to search.
Check the following link if you don't have it installed https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/

- ```gcloud``` CLI:
It will be necessary to consult the credentials of argocd in a secure way stored in GCP Secret Manager. 
Check the following link if you do not have it installed https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install?hl=es-419

- ```fzf```: It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list. 
See the following link if you don't have it installed https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

- ```GCP Secret Manger```: 
You will need to have a GCP project with 3 variables stored in secret manager corresponding to the argocd credentials

- ```awk```: 
For Unix or Unix-like systems (such as Linux or macOS), awk should already be available by default on most distributions. If for some reason you don't have it installed, you can install it using your system's package manager. For example: For Ubuntu or Debian, you can use the following command at the command line: ```sudo apt-get install gawk```. For macOS,  you can use the following command at the command line: ```brew install gawk```
## Settings

Edit the file ```argocd-search-app.sh``` and change environment variables

```bash
# GCP Secret Manger | Name of secrets
export SECRET_ARGOCD_SERVER="SECRET_NAME_ARGOCD_SERVER"
export SECRET_ARGOCD_USER="SECRET_NAME_ARGOCD_USER"
export SECRET_ARGOCD_PASSWORD="SECRET_NAME_ARGOCD_PASSWORD"
```

```bash
# Ensure the binary has to execute permissions
chmod +x argocd-search-app.sh
```

## Usage

- List all existing Healthy/Unhealthy apps

```bash
./argocd-search-app.sh

ðŸ’” app-1
ðŸ’š app-2
ðŸ’š app-3
ðŸ’š demo-1
ðŸ’” demo-2
ðŸ’š demo-3
ðŸ’š demo-4
ðŸ’š demo-5

```

- List only existing Healthy/Unhealthy apps with a filter by name. The following command will display only applications that have the word "demo" as part of the name.

```bash
./argocd-search-app.sh demo

ðŸ’š demo-1
ðŸ’” demo-2
ðŸ’š demo-3
ðŸ’š demo-4
ðŸ’š demo-5

```
- To navigate through the list as an interactive menu we will use the tools ```fzf```. You can use the up, down, mouse pointer and scroll keys to navigate between the list

```bash
./argocd-search-app.sh demo | fzf -0

  ðŸ’š demo-1
  ðŸ’” demo-2
  ðŸ’š demo-3
  ðŸ’š demo-4
> ðŸ’š demo-5
